## Running root-graphics-tests

Our project includes two types of tests: one written in C++ using the ROOT framework and the other written in JavaScript using Node.js. Below are the instructions to run each test.

### C++/JS Test with ROOT/JSROOT:

To run the C++ test, you need to have ROOT installed on your system. ROOT is a framework for data processing, developed by CERN. If you do not have ROOT installed, please visit the [ROOT Installation Guide](https://root.cern/install/) for installation instructions.

#### Running the Test in root-graphic-tests:
```shell
cd build
ctest
```
